  **Design Movement**: Modern Agrarian / Organic Tech
  **Core Principles**: Trustworthy, Scientific, Natural, Clean
  **Color Philosophy**: Earth tones meet clinical precision. Deep forest greens, warm wheat/grain golds, balanced with sterile whites and soft grays to convey "science of nature".
  **Layout Paradigm**: Card-based dashboard with a persistent side panel for mix summary. Asymmetric split screen for calculator input vs real-time analysis.
  **Signature Elements**: 
    - Grain texture overlays on section backgrounds
    - Detailed botanical illustrations of ingredients (seeds, peas, grains)
    - Circular progress rings for nutritional targets
  **Interaction Philosophy**: Immediate feedback. As users adjust sliders or inputs, the nutritional analysis updates instantly with smooth transitions.
  **Animation**: Gentle fade-ins for results. Progress bars fill up with an elastic ease. Warning cards slide in from the side.
  **Typography System**: 
    - Headings: 'Playfair Display' (Serif) for a touch of tradition and elegance
    - Body/UI: 'Inter' or 'DM Sans' for high readability and modern feel

  **Design Movement**: High-Performance Sport / Racing Aesthetic
  **Core Principles**: Speed, Precision, Data-Driven, Dynamic
  **Color Philosophy**: High contrast. Dark mode base (slate/charcoal) with vibrant neon accents (electric blue, signal orange) to highlight metrics and targets.
  **Layout Paradigm**: Dashboard cockpit feel. Dense data visualization. Modular grid system where every pixel works hard.
  **Signature Elements**: 
    - Angled dividers and containers (skewed rectangles)
    - Monospaced numbers for data points
    - Glowing gradients on active elements
  **Interaction Philosophy**: Snappy and sharp. Hover states trigger immediate high-contrast changes.
  **Animation**: Fast, linear transitions. Staggered reveals for list items.
  **Typography System**: 
    - Headings: 'Chakra Petch' or 'Teko' (Tech/Sport display)
    - Body/UI: 'Roboto Mono' for data, 'Roboto' for text

  **Design Movement**: Soft Minimalist / Avian Zen
  **Core Principles**: Calming, Simple, Airy, Focused
  **Color Philosophy**: Pastel palette. Soft sky blues, pale feather grays, muted sage greens. Lots of negative space.
  **Layout Paradigm**: Single column flow with generous margins. Floating elements with soft drop shadows.
  **Signature Elements**: 
    - Rounded corners (large border-radius)
    - Glassmorphism effects for overlays
    - Feather motifs as subtle background watermarks
  **Interaction Philosophy**: Gentle and forgiving. Soft bounces on clicks.
  **Animation**: Slow, floating animations. Elements drift into place.
  **Typography System**: 
    - Headings: 'Quicksand' or 'Nunito' (Rounded sans)
    - Body/UI: 'Lato' for clarity

## Selected Approach: Modern Agrarian / Organic Tech

I will proceed with the **Modern Agrarian / Organic Tech** approach. This style perfectly bridges the gap between the natural aspect of feeding birds and the scientific precision of the calculator. It builds trust and feels professional yet grounded.

**Key Design Decisions:**
- **Colors**: Primary deep green (`#2F5233`), Secondary wheat gold (`#D4AF37`), Background off-white/cream (`#F9F7F2`).
- **Typography**: 'Playfair Display' for headers to evoke premium/heritage feel, 'DM Sans' for UI elements for clarity.
- **Layout**: Split view where possible - input on left, real-time analysis on right (desktop). Stacked on mobile.
- **Visuals**: I will generate high-quality images of seed mixes and pigeons for the hero section.
