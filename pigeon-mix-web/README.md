# Pigeon Mix Web (legacy)

This directory is a placeholder for the original pigeon-only web app (v1). The multi-bird app lives in `pigeon-mix-web-multi-bird/`.

If you have the original pigeon web source, place it here (e.g., `client/`, `server/`) so both versions can coexist in the repository.

Notes:
- The Python CLI implementation and examples live in `pigeon-mix-web-multi-bird/pigeon-mix-web-multi-bird/python-package/pigeon_mix_calculator/` (canonical location).
- This placeholder was created during the repository restructure to keep the legacy application separate from the multi-bird rewrite.
