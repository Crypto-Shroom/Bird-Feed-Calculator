# Pigeon Mix Web (Legacy)

This folder is reserved for the original pigeon-only web experience. Place the legacy client/server code here so it can live alongside the multi-bird app in `../pigeon-mix-web-multi-bird/`.

Suggested structure:
- `client/` – Vite/React front-end for the pigeon-only calculator
- `server/` – Any API or backend logic dedicated to the pigeon variant
- `shared/` – Reusable constants or types that both sides consume
- `dist/` – Build artifacts for deployment

Document setup and run instructions for the pigeon-only variant inside this directory when you add the source.
