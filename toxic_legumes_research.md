# Toxic Legumes for Pigeons - Research Findings

## Key Findings

### Hemagglutinin/Lectin Content in Legumes

**Source**: The Spruce Pets, Avian rescue organizations, pigeon forums

**Critical Information**:
- Raw, uncooked beans contain **hemagglutinin** (also called lectin), which is extremely toxic to birds
- This toxin causes severe digestive damage, intestinal failure, and can be fatal
- Cooking beans properly eliminates the toxin

### Safe Raw Legumes for Pigeons
According to pigeon community forums and expert sources:
- **Lentils** (all types: red, green, yellow) - SAFE RAW
- **Split peas** - SAFE RAW
- **Mung beans** - SAFE RAW (contradictory info on one source, but majority consensus is safe)
- **Chickpeas** - Generally safe raw, though some sources recommend cooking
- **Peas** (garden peas) - SAFE RAW

### Unsafe Raw Legumes (Require Cooking)
- **Kidney beans** (red kidney beans) - TOXIC RAW, must be cooked
- **Lima beans** - TOXIC RAW, must be cooked
- **Fava beans** - TOXIC RAW, must be cooked
- **Black beans** - TOXIC RAW, must be cooked
- **Pinto beans** - TOXIC RAW, must be cooked
- **Navy beans** - TOXIC RAW, must be cooked
- **White beans** - TOXIC RAW, must be cooked
- **Any large dried beans** - TOXIC RAW

### Why This Wasn't Caught Initially
The oversight occurred because:
1. I focused on nutritional content (protein, carbs, fat) rather than safety toxins
2. I included common legumes without cross-checking which are safe raw vs. cooked
3. The research phase did not specifically target toxic compounds - it was general nutrition research
4. I should have proactively researched "toxic foods for pigeons" as a safety baseline

## Grain Compatibility Notes

### Grains That Can Be Solo
- **Corn** - While nutritious, should ideally be paired with other grains for nutrient diversity
- **Wheat** - Can be a primary grain
- **Barley** - Can be a primary grain
- **Oats** - Can be a primary grain
- **Rice** - Can be a primary grain

### Corn-Only Mix Issue
If corn is the ONLY grain in a mix:
- Missing B vitamins (especially thiamine from wheat/barley)
- Missing certain minerals from variety
- Lacks diversity in amino acid profile
- Should warn user to add at least one other grain

### Recommended Grain Combinations
- Corn + Wheat
- Wheat + Barley
- Corn + Oats
- Wheat + Rice
- Any combination of 2+ grains

## Herb Recommendations for Pet Profile
Need to add herbs for "Pet/Stay-at-Home" profile focusing on:
- Stress relief (chamomile, lavender)
- Digestive health (fennel, ginger)
- General wellness (oregano, thyme)
