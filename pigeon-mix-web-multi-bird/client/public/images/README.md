# Image placeholders

This folder should include the following image assets (not tracked in git to keep PRs binary-free):
- `hero-pigeon-mix.png` — hero banner for the landing page
- `ingredients-collage.png` — ingredient collage used in marketing sections
- `pigeon-portrait.png` — portrait used in feature callouts

Place your own PNGs here with the exact filenames above. They will be served statically by Vite during development and from `dist/public/images/` after a production build.
