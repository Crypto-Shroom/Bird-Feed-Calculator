# Multi-Bird Nutrition Research Findings

## Parrot Nutrition (Psittacines)
**Source:** Merck Veterinary Manual - Nutrition in Psittacines

### Protein Requirements
- **Budgerigars & Cockatiels:** 7-12% (maintenance)
- **Grey & Timneh Parrots:** 10-15% (maintenance)
- **Growing birds & egg-laying hens:** Higher than maintenance
- **Molting periods:** Greatly increased, especially need for cysteine (sulfur-containing amino acid)
- **Note:** Excessive protein can cause renal insufficiency and gout in predisposed birds
- **Recommendation:** Increase protein gradually to avoid kidney damage

### Fat Requirements
- **Range:** 5-12% depending on species, body condition, and reproductive stage
- **Minimum polyunsaturated fat:** At least 1% of dry diet (linoleic acid)
- **Special case:** Hyacinth macaws need higher fat (15% nuts in diet) due to natural palm nut diet
- **Warning:** Excessive fat leads to obesity, metabolic disease, cardiac disease, atherosclerosis

### Vitamins
- Fat-soluble vitamins (A, D3, E, K) stored longer - overdosing risk
- Vitamin D3: Active form created by sunlight on skin; dietary supplementation unnecessary if adequate lighting
- Vitamin A: Carotenoids in diet don't cause overdose (body converts only as needed)

### Toxic Foods for Parrots
- Avocado (pit, skin, and flesh)
- Chocolate
- Salt
- Onions and garlic
- Xylitol
- Fruit pits and apple seeds
- Caffeine

## Finch Nutrition
**Source:** Finch Information Center - Nutritional Requirements

### Protein Requirements
- Research-based data is limited; poultry data not applicable
- Finches consume up to 30% of body weight daily (vs. poultry 6%)
- Enzyme activity (maltase, saccharase, amylase, lipase) much higher than poultry
- **Recommendation:** Use formulated diets made specifically for finches

### Fat Requirements
- **Range:** 8-15% (but many seed diets provide >40%)
- **Essential fatty acid:** Linoleic acid primary requirement
- **Warning:** High fat leads to obesity and interferes with calcium absorption
- **Warning:** Low fat leads to decreased weight and disease resistance
- **Caution:** Rancid fats reduce amino acid availability

### Carbohydrates
- Only energy source usable by nervous system
- Deficiency causes neurological signs
- Finches can become hypoglycemic if deprived of food

### Vitamins
- **Vitamin K:** Passerines may lack intestinal bacterial flora, so dietary K needed
- **Vitamin C:** Passerines may require ascorbic acid in diet
- **Biotin:** Deficiency associated with wheat and barley; implicated in fatty liver/kidney syndrome
- **Niacin:** High millet diets (high leucine) can interfere with tryptophan-to-niacin conversion
- **Riboflavin:** Likely limiting in seed diets for laying hens

### Toxic Foods for Finches
- Moldy foods
- Rhubarb
- Chocolate
- Alcohol (extremely toxic, even trace amounts)
- Fermented foods and yeast-based dough
- Avocado
- Caffeine
- Onions and garlic
- Xylitol

## Dove Nutrition
**Sources:** Various pet care resources

### Protein Requirements
- Similar to finches; formulated diets recommended
- Higher protein during breeding and egg-laying

### Calcium Requirements
- Especially important for egg shell production
- Needed for feeding squabs (rapid bone development)
- Cuttlebone, crushed oyster shells, or eggshells recommended

### Toxic Foods for Doves
- Same as finches and parrots: avocado, chocolate, caffeine, onions, garlic, xylitol

## Common Toxic Foods Across All Pet Birds
1. **Avocado** - Contains persin (fatty acid-like substance); lethal
2. **Chocolate** - Contains theobromine (toxic)
3. **Caffeine** - Stimulant toxin
4. **Onions & Garlic** - Contain thiosulfates
5. **Xylitol** - Artificial sweetener (toxic)
6. **Salt** - Excessive amounts harmful
7. **Fruit pits & apple seeds** - Contain cyanogenic compounds
8. **Alcohol** - Cannot be processed by birds
9. **Moldy foods** - Contain mycotoxins
10. **Heavy metals** - Lead, zinc, copper, mercury (from water, paint, toys)

## Bird-Specific Profiles for Calculator

### Parrots
- Maintenance: 10-15% protein, 5-12% fat
- Breeding/Molting: 15-18% protein, 8-12% fat
- Pet/Companion: 10-12% protein, 5-8% fat

### Finches
- Maintenance: 12-14% protein, 8-12% fat
- Breeding: 14-16% protein, 10-15% fat
- Pet/Companion: 12-13% protein, 8-10% fat

### Doves
- Maintenance: 10-12% protein, 5-10% fat
- Breeding: 12-14% protein, 8-12% fat
- Pet/Companion: 10-11% protein, 5-8% fat

## Ingredient Compatibility Notes

### Safe for All Birds
- Wheat, barley, oats, millet, corn (yellow preferred for vitamin A)
- Lentils, peas, mung beans, chickpeas
- Sunflower seeds, safflower seeds, hemp seeds
- Herbs: basil, oregano, thyme, parsley (in moderation)

### Parrot-Specific Cautions
- Avoid high-fat seeds for sedentary birds (obesity risk)
- Monitor protein levels in birds with renal predisposition

### Finch-Specific Cautions
- Avoid wheat and barley in excess (biotin deficiency risk)
- High millet diets can cause niacin deficiency
- Monitor fat levels (many seed diets too high)

### Dove-Specific Cautions
- Ensure adequate calcium supplementation
- Monitor fat intake for sedentary birds
